{"name":"No Boilerplate","tagline":"*Really* DRY","body":"### Welcome to No Boilerplate\r\n\r\nI've been programming for almost three (3) decades now and I'm in love with it as ever. But where before I was younger and had *more* patience for brutality of repetition, if not in code, then in code structure, today I **really** hate repeating myself. Hence this site where I'll be creating and curating things that save me code and typing, but not in some kind of \"generalized library\" sort of way, but *really* saving it by allowing me to work on a higher level of abstraction.\r\n\r\nHere are the rules of engagement for no-boilerplate projects:\r\n\r\n1. No code generation - instead we \"run\" higher-level abstracts and allow for behavior customization with hooks for lower-level code if needed.\r\n2. No backward compatibility - instead, if there are any braking changes, we convert old higher-level abstracts to new higher-level abstracts (either on fly or permanently)\r\n\r\nFirst of these projects is: [no-boilerplate-passport](https://github.com/no-boilerplate/no-boilerplate-passport) for declarative configuration of [Passport](http://passportjs.org) authentication middleware for Node.js.\r\n\r\nI hope this turns out to be useful.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n@ierceg","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
